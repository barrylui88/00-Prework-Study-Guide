# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The Prework Study Guide Webpage has been built to help guide new students to the contents of the prework at a high level with some useful bullet points. This will make it easy for them to see very quickly what sort of topics they will be studying. In the process of building this webpage, we have learned the basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript as well as executing the Git workflow.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

At a high level, the webpage is accessed via a URL. Upon loading the page, the user will be able to see a list of helpful bullet points separated by each topic. There is also some additional functionality in the console which is not immediately visible to the user. By loading the console, we have listed the topic and also added a random 'topic generator'. This generates a message with a randomly generated topic from an array created in JavaScript.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
